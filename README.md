# New Mexico Programming Group - PhoneGap

This is a simple Android camera application for New Mexico Programming Group (NMPG)
using PhoneGap. This code based on the 2.9.0 cordova. 

## Mileage will vary

If you are having issues with the index.html not found (a timeout), make sure that
you have the correct ip address if you are using weinre, or just disable it :-)
(but keep the code around, its really a nice debugging tool).
